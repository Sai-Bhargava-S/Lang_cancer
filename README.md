# Lung Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project is a Lung Cancer Prediction System built using Machine Learning and Streamlit. It helps predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on user-input symptoms. The model is trained using Logistic Regression, achieving:

Training Accuracy: 93%
Testing Accuracy: 89%
Technologies Used
Python
Streamlit (for the web interface)
Logistic Regression (for model training)
Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)
Pickle (for saving the trained model)

pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn pickle-mixin
2. Run the Streamlit App
arduino
Copy
Edit
streamlit run Lang_Cancer.py
Dataset
The dataset used (survey lung cancer.csv) contains symptoms and lifestyle factors that influence lung cancer.
The features include smoking habits, anxiety, fatigue, chest pain, wheezing, etc.
Model Performance
The Logistic Regression Model was trained on this dataset, achieving:

Training Accuracy: 93%
Testing Accuracy: 89%
